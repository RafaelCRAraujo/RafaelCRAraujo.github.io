Abstract: This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forestation -- i.e., when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon. We propose a dynamic discrete choice model of land use and estimate it using a panel of land use and carbon stock of 5.7 billion pixels between 2008 and 2017. Business-as-usual implies an inefficient release of 44 gigatons of CO2 in the long run resulting from deforestation of an area twice the size of France. We find that small carbon taxes can mitigate a substantial part of inefficient deforestation. Only relatively larger taxes on cattle production would achieve a similar effect.

<h3><a href="assets/papers/Deforestation_rainfall_energy.pdf"> Valuing Tropical Forests: Deforestation, Rainfall, and Hydropower</a></h3>

Tropical forests affect rainfall regimes in a continental scale. This paper develops an approach to value this important ecological service to the energy sector. I develop an econometric climate model that connects tropical deforestation with rainfall hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away from the forest. As an application, I estimate the impact that Amazon deforestation has on the power generation capacity of the Teles Pires hydropower plant in Brazil, a country that has hydropower as its main source of energy. The decrease on energy generation is higher in the wet season, with an average decrease of 10% and extreme scenarios of 17%, amounting to a potential loss for the hydroelectric operator of USD 21 million per year. I then map the regions of the Amazon that would have the highest values of preservation for the hydroelectric operator. These results provide evidence of the economic importance of ecological services provided by tropical forests to economic activities.

<h3>When Clouds Go Dry: An Integrated Model of Deforestation, Rainfall, and Agriculture</h3>

Deforestation in tropical forests affects rainfall, changing the productivity of the agricultural sector, the main driver of deforestation. This deforestation-rainfall mechanism results in a sizable externality, since it is in effect even in regions that are thousands of kilometers away from the forest. I develop an integrated climate and land use model to measure the externality impact that land use decisions have on agricultural productivity. As an application, I use pixel level climate data for the entire Amazon Rainforest and pixel level land use data for the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso, one of the most important agricultural hubs in the world. I then consider a counterfactual where farmers are allowed to deforest protected areas. In this counterfactual, due to the precipitation decrease resulting from deforestation, the returns of crop production decreases on average by 4% with some regions losing up to 11%.

<h3>Public Attention Reduced Forest Fires in the Brazilian Amazon</h3>

International frameworks and agreements to reduce anthropogenic environmental disasters rely on international pressure driving local action. Although environmental catastrophes can occasionally capture international attention, it is unclear if focused media and increased public outcry can reduce environmental damage. We study the unusual and concentrated increase in international scrutiny on forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon in August 2019. Comparing active fires in the Brazilian Amazon versus those in the Peruvian and Bolivian Amazon before and after a surge in public attention on the Brazilian Amazon, we find that increased public attention reduced fires by 22% (93,607 avoided pixel-days of active fire) avoiding 24.81 million MtCO2 in emissions. Our results highlight the power of public pressure to compel governments to act on pressing environmental issues, even in political contexts hostile to environmental priorities.
