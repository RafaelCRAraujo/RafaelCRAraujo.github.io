This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forest cover -- i.e. when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon. We propose a dynamic discrete choice land-use model and estimate it using a panel of land use and carbon stock of 5.7 billion pixels between 2008 and 2017. The business-as-usual scenario implies an inefficient release of 42 billion tons of CO2 in the long run resulting from the deforestation of an area twice the size of France. A carbon tax that makes farmers internalize the social cost of carbon would implement the efficient allocation and generate welfare gains exceeding 1.6 trillion dollars. Responses from a carbon tax are highly convex: a carbon tax of only $10/ton would preserve 95% of the efficient carbon stock. An excise tax on cattle ranching, a second-best policy, achieves at most 87% of the first-best welfare gains.

## Working papers

<h3><a href="assets/papers/WhenCloudsGoDry.pdf"> When Clouds Go Dry: An Integrated Model of Deforestation, Rainfall, and Agriculture</a></h3>

I develop a discrete choice model of deforestation with spatially heterogeneous endogenous climate. Using pixel-level data for the Amazon Rainforest and the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso,  one of the most important agricultural hubs in the world, I estimate the model and consider a counterfactual where farmers are allowed to deforest protected areas. Deforestation reduces rainfall and increases temperatures for downwind farmers, creating cascading effects on a network of externalities. Ignoring climate feedback loops significantly underestimates the costs of deforestation, highlighting the importance of considering climate endogeneity beyond the production-emissions-temperature framework.

Investments in transportation infrastructure can impact the environment beyond their immediate surroundings. We build an inter-regional trade model to estimate the general equilibrium effects of changes in infrastructure on deforestation. Using panel data on the evolution of the transportation network from Brazil and land use data in the Amazon, we estimate the model and find sizable effects of infrastructure on deforestation. Model simulations show that ignoring general equilibrium underestimates deforestation impacts by one quarter. We also show that this model can be used to evaluate the deforestation induced by individual projects, an essential input for public policies.

Gender gaps in land ownership are common across the world, favoring male-headed households with more wealth and land.  In low- and middle-income countries, where women lack property, inheritance, and credit rights, these disparities contribute to gender inequality in rural areas. The adoption of advanced agricultural technology, while economically positive, can worsen gender disparities. This paper studies the impact of new agricultural technologies on female land ownership, focusing on genetically engineered (GE) soy seeds in Brazil. Despite technology's potential to reduce gender inequality, we find a significant decline in female landownership in GE soy-exposed regions. We examine the role of mechanisms like credit access, property rights, and gender norms. We find that the effects are more pronounced where rural credit is more abundant, property rights are stronger, and gender norms are more unequal. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of the spread of new technologies on rural asset ownership, underscoring the importance of considering gender disparities in crafting agricultural and climate change strategies.

with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/leilaarp/">Leila Pereira</a> and <a href="https://rogeriosantarrosa.wordpress.com/">Rogerio Santarrosa</a>

We examine the impact of short-term temperature changes on voting behavior in the Brazilian presidential elections from 2010 to 2018, focusing on the candidacy of Marina Silva, a prominent pro-environment politician. Using data on municipality-level voting and daily wet bulb temperature, we find that an increase in temperature on election day increases votes for Marina Silva. We argue that this effect is driven by the salience of climate change issues, which influences last-minute voting decisions. Our analysis also shows that temperature variations in the days preceding the election have a limited impact on voting outcomes, highlighting the transient nature of climate salience effects.
