# Welcome

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://economics-sp.fgv.br/">FGV EESP</a>.

I am interested in environmental issues and their social effects. 

Feel free to contact me about research, code, and data.

## Working papers

<h3><a href="assets/papers/WhenCloudsGoDry.pdf"> When Clouds Go Dry: An Integrated Model of Deforestation, Rainfall, and Agriculture</a></h3>

I develop a discrete choice model of deforestation with spatially heterogeneous endogenous climate. Using pixel-level data for the Amazon Rainforest and the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso,  one of the most important agricultural hubs in the world, I estimate the model and consider a counterfactual where farmers are allowed to deforest protected areas. Deforestation reduces rainfall and increases temperatures for downwind farmers, creating cascading effects on a network of externalities. Ignoring climate feedback loops significantly underestimates the costs of deforestation, highlighting the importance of considering climate endogeneity beyond the production-emissions-temperature framework.

with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bruna-pugialli-silva-borges">Bruna Borges</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fjmcosta/">Francisco Costa</a>,  and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kellygonsantos/home">Kelly Santos</a> 

Gender gaps in land ownership are common across the world, favoring male-headed households with more wealth and land.  In low- and middle-income countries, where women lack property, inheritance, and credit rights, these disparities contribute to gender inequality in rural areas. The adoption of advanced agricultural technology, while economically positive, can worsen gender disparities. This paper studies the impact of new agricultural technologies on female land ownership, focusing on genetically engineered (GE) soy seeds in Brazil. Despite technology's potential to reduce gender inequality, we find a significant decline in female landownership in GE soy-exposed regions. We examine the role of mechanisms like credit access, property rights, and gender norms. We find that the effects are more pronounced where rural credit is more abundant, property rights are stronger, and gender norms are more unequal. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of the spread of new technologies on rural asset ownership, underscoring the importance of considering gender disparities in crafting agricultural and climate change strategies.

with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/leilaarp/">Leila Pereira</a> and <a href="https://rogeriosantarrosa.wordpress.com/">Rogerio Santarrosa</a>

We examine the impact of short-term temperature changes on voting behavior in the Brazilian presidential elections from 2010 to 2018, focusing on the candidacy of Marina Silva, a prominent pro-environment politician. Using data on municipality-level voting and daily wet bulb temperature, we find that an increase in temperature on election day increases votes for Marina Silva. We argue that this effect is driven by the salience of climate change issues, which influences last-minute voting decisions. Our analysis also shows that temperature variations in the days preceding the election have a limited impact on voting outcomes, highlighting the transient nature of climate salience effects.

<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12141">Potato Potahto in the FAO-GAEZ Productivity Measures? Nonclassical Measurement Error with Multiple Proxies</a></h3>
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vitorapossebom/">Vitor Possebom</a>

The FAO-GAEZ crop productivity data are widely used in Economics. However, the existence of measurement error is rarely recognized in the empirical literature. We propose a novel method to partially identify the effect of agricultural productivity, deriving bounds that allow for nonclassical measurement error by leveraging two proxies. These bounds exhaust all the information contained in the first two moments of the data. We reevaluate three influential studies, documenting that measurement error matters and that the impact of agricultural productivity on economic outcomes may be smaller than previously reported. Our methodology has broad applications in empirical research involving mismeasured variables.
