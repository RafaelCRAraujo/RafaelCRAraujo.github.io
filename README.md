# Welcome

I am a Phd student of Economics at Getulio Vargas Foundation (Rio de Janeiro - Brazil) and a Senior Analyst of Sustainable Infrastructure at Climate Policy Initiative.

I am interested in environmental issues, particularly their social effects. 

Feel free to reach out about research, Python, and data.
