<h3>Efficient Forestation in the Brazilian Amazon: Evidence from a Dynamic Model</h3> 
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fjmcosta/">Francisco Costa</a>  and <a href="https://marcelosantanna.wordpress.com/">Marcelo Sant'Anna</a> 

Abstract: This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forestation -- i.e., when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon. We propose a dynamic discrete choice model of land use and estimate it using a panel of land use and carbon stock of 5.7 billion pixels between 2008 and 2017. Business-as-usual implies an inefficient release of 44 gigatons of $CO_2$ in the long run resulting from deforestation of an area twice the size of France. We find that small carbon taxes can mitigate a substantial part of inefficient deforestation. Only relatively larger taxes on cattle production would achieve a similar effect.
