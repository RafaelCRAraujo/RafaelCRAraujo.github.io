# Welcome

I am a Senior Analyst of Sustainable Infrastructure at <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/">Climate Policy Initiative</a> and a PhD student of Economics at <a href="https://epge.fgv.br/en">Getulio Vargas Foundation</a>, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I am interested in environmental issues, particularly their social effects.

Abstract: This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forestation -- i.e., when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon. We propose a dynamic discrete choice model of land use and estimate it using a panel of land use and carbon stock of 5.7 billion pixels between 2008 and 2017. Business-as-usual implies an inefficient release of 44 gigatons of CO2 in the long run resulting from deforestation of an area twice the size of France. We find that small carbon taxes can mitigate a substantial part of inefficient deforestation. Only relatively larger taxes on cattle production would achieve a similar effect.

<h3>The Value of Amazon’s Flying Rivers for the Energy Sector: the Case of Teles Pires Hydroelectric</h3>

Tropical forests have the capacity to affect rainfall regimes in a continental scale. In particular, the Amazon Rainforest provides a significant share of the South America's rainfall. This paper provides an approach to value this important ecological service of tropical forests to the energy sector. The Brazilian energy sector, where hydropower is the predominant source of energy, is particularly vulnerable to changes in rainfall and thus to impacts that deforestation has on rainfall. I develop an econometric climate model that connects the tropical deforestation with rainfall hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away from the forest. As an application, I estimate the impact that Amazon deforestation has on the power generation capacity of the Teles Pires hydropower plant. For some months of the year, the mean effect of lost generation capacity is of 10\% with extreme scenarios of 17\%, amounting to a potential loss for the hydroelectric operator of USD 21 million per year. I thenmap the regions of the Amazon that would have the highest values of preservation for the hydroelectric operator.

<h3>When clouds go dry: an integrated model of deforestation, rainfall, and agriculture</h3>

Deforestation in tropical forests is the result of agricultural land use expansion which intends to maximize profits. Nevertheless, deforestation affects precipitation patterns regulated by the forest and thus can negatively impact agriculture. In this paper, I integrate a discrete choice model of land use with a climate model of precipitation to measure the externality impact that land use decisions have on the production of the agricultural sector. As an application, I estimate the climate model using pixel level data for the entire Amazon Rainforest and the land use model with pixel level data for the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso, one of the most important agricultural hubs in the world. I then consider a counterfactual where farmers are allowed to deforest protected indigenous territories. In this counterfactual, deforestation would soar, precipitation would decrease on average by 2% with some regions losing up to 4% and returns of crop production would decrease on average by 4% with some regions losing up to 11%.
